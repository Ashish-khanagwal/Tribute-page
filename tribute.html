      <ul class="About">
        <li>
          He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the
          internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it is
          simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math
          was one area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His
          involvement is often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he helped
          create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter to
          President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which
          led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated pacifist and,
          later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America
          needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn&#39;t work
          out, Einstein could have become a violinist. His mother played piano
          so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin lessons—at the
          young age of five.
        </li>
        <li>
          He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel&#39;s first
          president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einstein was offered the position,
          but he declined.
        </li>
        <li>
          He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva
          Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite
          a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He had affairs
          he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to Berlin without
          discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.
        </li>
        <li>
          He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn&#39;t
          particularly surprising. What is surprising is the fact that he
          didn&#39;t receive it for the general or special theory of relativity,
          but rather for the photoelectric effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby.
          But by his own admission, he never made a particularly good sailor. In
          fact, he didn&#39;t even know how to swim.
        </li>
        <li>
          He really didn&#39;t like socks, and usually didn&#39;t wear them. In
          fact, in a letter to Elsa, he bragged about getting away “without
          wearing socks” while at Oxford.
        </li>
        <li>
          He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn&#39;t known until the
          1980s, but according to correspondence between Albert and Mileva it
          was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At
          one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is
          unknown.
        </li>
        <li class="last-li">
          His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his
          autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually got the
          permission necessary from Einstein&#39;s son, but he was fired from
          Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over
          forty years before finally returning it in 1998.
